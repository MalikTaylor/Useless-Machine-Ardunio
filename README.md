# Useless-Machine-Ardunio
As a beginner robotics hobbyist I wanted to find a begginer friendly project that would use the Arduino microcrontroller as the brains of my project. While browsing the internet I came across the Useless machine which is a . However I noticed that all these machines would repeat the same action every time and I wanteed to change that, so i set out to build my own. 

## Construction

I really like some of the Useless machines that have a wooden encolusre, but I have no expirence with wood working so I instead, opted to 3D print the enclosure for this version of the project. I have plans to create a wooden enclosure in the future and even include an internal power source.  


## Software

The sketch is fairly simple which selects a random servo animation to play when the user flips the toggle switch. This sketch is not perfect, as the Useless machine will sometimes repeat a previously selected animation multiple times.
